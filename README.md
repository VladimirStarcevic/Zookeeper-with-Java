Animal Habitat Viewer 🐪🦁🦌
This Java console application simulates a camera system that displays information about various animal habitats. Users can select from six habitats (camel, lion, deer, goose, bat, and rabbit) and view fun ASCII art along with brief animal descriptions. The program continues to display habitats based on user input until they type "exit" to end the session.
